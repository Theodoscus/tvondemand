Project created using MySQL and JAVA GUI (as demanded by the course) by Theodosios Chronopoulos for databases course at Computer Science and Informatics Department UoP.

The purpose of the project was to create a movie and series rental service with a fully functional database, create users, import data, create triggers and stored procedures and implement some virtual functions. The goal was not the full functionality of the specific project, since in reality the user cannot see any series or movie, but the understanding of the functionality of a database.
